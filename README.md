# üìò DSA Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and logic-building challenges. These scripts are excellent for beginners and intermediates preparing for coding interviews or strengthening their problem-solving skills.

## üìÇ File Overview

| File Name                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `airplane.py`            | Implements a logic problem related to airplane seat allocation or simulation. |
| `armstrong.py`           | Checks whether a number is an Armstrong number. |
| `bit_find.py`            | Uses bitwise operations to solve a specific bit manipulation problem. |
| `bitmask.py`             | Demonstrates bit masking techniques for solving binary-based problems. |
| `bubble_sort.py`         | Classic implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. |
| `factorial.py`           | Computes the factorial of a number (recursive/iterative). |
| `list_sort.py`           | Sorts a list using built-in or custom sorting logic. |
| `match_string_naive.py`  | Implements naive pattern matching for string search. |
| `move_zeroes.py`         | Moves all zeroes to the end of a list while maintaining relative order. |
| `next_greater_no.py`     | Finds the next greater number using the digits of the current number. |
| `next_greater_no_2app.py`| Alternative approach to the next greater number problem. |
| `odd_even.py`            | Checks if a number is odd or even. |
| `rand_pass_gen.py`       | Generates a random password using predefined criteria. |
| `reverse_no.py`          | Reverses the digits of a given number. |
| `reverse_stack.py`       | Reverses a stack using recursion or an auxiliary stack. |
| `running_sums.py`        | Computes running sum of a list (prefix sum). |
| `sort_stack.py`          | Sorts a stack using only stack operations. |
